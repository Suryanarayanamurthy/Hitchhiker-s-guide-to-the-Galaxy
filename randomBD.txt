"So, in conclusion, you're both equally mercurial, overly sensitive, clingy, hysterical bird-brain homunculi. And I honestly can't even tell the two of you apart half the time because I don't go by height or age, I go by amount of pain in my ass-which makes you both identical. All right, everything resolved? Everybody nice and certain about their position in my world? # Rick Sanchez"

 "Rick, forgive me for doing this in notes. I'm not strong enough to do it in persons. I realize now that I'm attracted to you for the same reason I can't be with you. You can't change. And I have no problem with that, but it clearly means I have a problem with myself. I'm sure there's no perfect version of me. I'm sure I'll just unify species after species and never really be complete. But I know how it goes with us. I lose who I am and become part of you. Because in a strange way, you're better at what I do without even trying. Yours, and nobody else's... # Unity."

"Discipline is the suppression of base desires, and is usually understood to be synonymous with restraint and self-control. Self-discipline is to some extent a substitute for motivation.[1] Discipline is when one uses reason to determine the best course of action regardless of one's desires, which may be the opposite of exited. Virtuous behavior can be described as when one's values are aligned with one's aims: to do what one knows is best and to do it gladly. Continent behavior, on the other hand, is when one does what one knows is best, but must do it by opposing one's motivations.[2] Moving from continent to virtuous behavior requires training and some self-discipline. #Wiki"

“Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mind-bogglingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have chosen to see it as the final and clinching proof of the non-existence of God.
The argument goes something like this: "I refuse to prove that I exist,'" says God, "for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing."
"But," says Man, "The Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn't it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so therefore, by your own arguments, you don't. QED."
"Oh dear," says God, "I hadn't thought of that," and promptly vanishes in a puff of logic.
"Oh, that was easy," says Man, and for an encore goes on to prove that black is white and gets himself killed on the next zebra crossing.

"Your Time Will Come

Kenya is two hours ahead of Nigeria. It  does not mean that Nigeria is slow, and Kenya is faster. Both countries are working based on their own "Time Zone."

 Someone got married and 'waited' ten years before having a child, and there is another who had a baby within one year of a late marriage.

 Someone graduated at the age of 22, yet waited 5 years before securing a job; and there is another who graduated at the age of 27 and secured employment immediately.

Someone became CEO at the age of 25 and died at the age of 50 while another became a CEO at the age of 50 and lived upto 90 years. 

Everyone worked according to their 'Time Zone'.. 

Colleagues, friends, associates, younger one(s) might "seem" to go ahead of you. Don't envy them, it's their 'Time Zone.'. Yours is coming soon. Hold on, be strong, and stay true to yourself. All things will work together for your good. You’re not late… you’re on time! #--"

“It is known that there are an infinite number of worlds, simply because there is an infinite amount of space for them to be in. However, not every one of them is inhabited. Therefore, there must be a finite number of inhabited worlds. Any finite number divided by infinity is as near to nothing as makes no odds, so the average population of all the planets in the Universe can be said to be zero. From this it follows that the population of the whole Universe is also zero, and that any people you may meet from time to time are merely the products of a deranged imagination.
